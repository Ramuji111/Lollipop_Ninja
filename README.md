# Lollipop_Ninja
The Lollipop Ninja game is a 2D game that challenges players to capture a
lollipop and escape without being seen by enemies. The game is built using
the Python programming language and utilizes the tkinter and pygame
modules. Players must use stealth and strategy to navigate through a series of
increasingly difficult levels, each filled with enemies that must be avoided or
defeated. Along the way, players can collect power-ups and upgrades that
help them on their mission.
